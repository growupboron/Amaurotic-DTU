# Amaurotic

We, at Team Kamikaze believe in providing education to all. And seeing the alarming illiteracy rate of optically disabled people, we went to dig on the reasons that is causing such a disparity on the grounds of education. After our thorough research and possible solution, we came up with the idea of Amaurotic.

Amaurotic is a portable braille reader, which does not include any heavy priced printed materials or thermal portable braille device. Instead, it is a mechanical solution to the problem, thus making education accesible and affordable to all.

Using the technologies like machine learning, mechanical leverage, Optical Character Reading and Text-to-Audio services, we were able to achieve this product, which is targeted at lower pay income brackets.
